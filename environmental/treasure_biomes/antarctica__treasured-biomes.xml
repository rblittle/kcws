      <description>Vinson Massif is Antarctica’s highest mountain. Its steep, icy slopes rise above a vast white wilderness, where extreme cold, wind, and endless snow make every step a serious challenge.</description>

      <name>Weddell Sea</name>
      <image url="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/icebergs-weddell-sea-antarctica-476199661" />
      <description>The Weddell Sea is known for thick pack ice and massive icebergs. Along the shifting ice edge, seals, penguins, and whales find food in cold, nutrient‑rich water.</description>

    <biome>
      <name>Antarctic Plateau</name>
      <image url="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/sunset-viewed-south-pole-1202349709" />
      <description>Antarctica’s plateau is a high, dry desert of ice near the continent’s center. It is flat, brutal, and incredibly cold, with clear skies and long stretches of silence.</description>
