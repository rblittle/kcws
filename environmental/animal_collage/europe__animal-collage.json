Ever resourceful, they scavenge leftovers from larger predators, ensuring nothing goes to waste in the frozen north."

        "description": "Eurasian lynxes stalk silently through the forest on snowshoe-like paws. Their tufted ears swivel to track the faintest sounds. With sudden pounces, these elusive cats keep hare numbers in check, which in turn lets young trees grow in sunlit clearings."
